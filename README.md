# weather-forecast-app


This is a weather forecast application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to input a city name and get the current weather, hourly forecast (next 6 hours), and a 5-day weather forecast. The app fetches data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and displays it in a clean and responsive user interface.
